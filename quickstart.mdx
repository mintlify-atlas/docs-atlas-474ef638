This guide will help you get started with Conda's core functionality: managing packages and creating environments.

## Basic Package Management

Conda makes it easy to view, search, and install packages.

### Listing Installed Packages

If you installed the Anaconda Distribution, you will already have hundreds of packages installed. You can see what packages are installed by running:

```bash
$ conda list
```

This displays all packages currently installed in your active environment.

### Searching for Packages

To see all the packages that are available:

```bash
$ conda search
```

To search for a specific package:

```bash
$ conda search numpy
```

### Installing Packages

To install a package, use:

```bash
$ conda install <package-name>
```

For example, to install NumPy:

```bash
$ conda install numpy
```

## Working with Environments

The real power of conda comes from its ability to manage environments. In conda, an environment can be thought of as a completely separate installation.

### Why Use Environments?

Conda installs packages into environments efficiently using [hard links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) by default when it is possible, so environments are space efficient, and take seconds to create.

Environments allow you to:
- Isolate project dependencies
- Use different versions of packages for different projects
- Avoid conflicts between package requirements
- Easily share reproducible environments

### Understanding the Base Environment

The default environment, which `conda` itself is installed into, is called `base`. This is the environment you're using when you first open a terminal after installing Conda.

## Creating Your First Environment

Let's create a new environment for a machine learning project.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the environment">
    To create an environment with PyTorch, run:
    
    ```bash
    $ conda create --name ml-project pytorch
    ```
    
    This creates an environment called `ml-project` with the latest version of PyTorch and its dependencies.
    
    <Note>
      You can create an environment with multiple packages at once by listing them:
      ```bash
      $ conda create --name my-env python=3.11 numpy pandas matplotlib
      ```
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate the environment">
    Once the environment is created, activate it:
    
    ```bash
    $ conda activate ml-project
    ```
    
    This puts the `bin` directory of the `ml-project` environment in the front of the `PATH`, and sets it as the default environment for all subsequent conda commands.
    
    After activation, your terminal prompt will typically show the environment name:
    ```
    (ml-project) $
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install additional packages (optional)">
    With the environment activated, you can install additional packages:
    
    ```bash
    $ conda install numpy pandas
    ```
    
    These packages will be installed only in the `ml-project` environment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deactivate the environment">
    To go back to the base environment, use:
    
    ```bash
    $ conda deactivate
    ```
    
    This returns you to the `base` environment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Reference

Here's a handy reference for the most common Conda commands:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Package Management
# List installed packages
conda list

# Search for packages
conda search <package-name>

# Install a package
conda install <package-name>

# Update a package
conda update <package-name>

# Remove a package
conda remove <package-name>
```

```bash Environment Management
# Create a new environment
conda create --name <env-name>

# Create environment with specific packages
conda create --name <env-name> python=3.11 numpy pandas

# Activate an environment
conda activate <env-name>

# Deactivate current environment
conda deactivate

# List all environments
conda env list

# Remove an environment
conda env remove --name <env-name>
```

```bash Conda Management
# Update conda itself
conda update --name base conda

# Check conda version
conda --version

# View conda configuration
conda config --show
```
</CodeGroup>

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for starting a new Python project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project-specific environment">
    ```bash
    $ conda create --name data-analysis python=3.11 pandas matplotlib jupyter
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate the environment">
    ```bash
    $ conda activate data-analysis
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Work on your project">
    With the environment activated, all packages you install and use will be isolated to this project.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deactivate when done">
    ```bash
    $ conda deactivate
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
