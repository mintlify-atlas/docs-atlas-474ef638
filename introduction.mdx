---

Conda is a cross-platform, language-agnostic binary package manager. It is a package manager used in conda distributions like [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), but it may be used for other systems as well.

## What is Conda?

Conda makes environments first-class citizens, making it easy to create independent environments even for C libraries. The conda command line interface is written entirely in Python, and is BSD licensed open source.

Conda is enhanced by organizations, tools, and repositories created and managed by the amazing members of the [conda community](https://conda.org/).

## Key Features

### Cross-Platform Package Management

Conda works seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a consistent package management experience regardless of your operating system.

### Environment Management

The real power of conda comes from its ability to manage environments. In conda, an environment can be thought of as a completely separate installation. Conda installs packages into environments efficiently using [hard links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) by default when it is possible, so environments are space efficient, and take seconds to create.

### Language-Agnostic

While conda is written in Python, it can manage packages and dependencies for any language, including Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, and more.

### Efficient Storage

Conda uses hard links to create space-efficient environments that can be created in seconds without duplicating files.

### Community-Driven

Conda is supported by a vibrant community that maintains channels like [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) and [Bioconda](https://bioconda.org/), providing access to thousands of packages.
