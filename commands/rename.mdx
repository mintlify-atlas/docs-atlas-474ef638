description: Rename an existing environment
---

The `conda rename` command renames an existing conda environment by cloning it to a new location and removing the original.

## Syntax

```bash
conda rename [options] DESTINATION
```

## Arguments

### `DESTINATION`
New name for the conda environment.

Can be either:
- A simple name (environment will be created in default envs directory)
- A full path (environment will be created at that location)

```bash
conda rename -n oldenv newenv
conda rename -n oldenv /path/to/newenv
```

## Options

### `-n, --name NAME`
Name of the environment to rename.

```bash
conda rename -n test123 test321
conda rename --name test123 test321
```

### `-p, --prefix PREFIX`
Full path to the environment prefix to rename.

```bash
conda rename -p /path/to/test123 test321
conda rename --prefix /path/to/test123 test321
```

### `-y, --yes`
Do not ask for confirmation. If the destination environment already exists, it will be overwritten.

```bash
conda rename -n oldenv newenv --yes
```

<Warning>
Using `--yes` will overwrite the destination environment if it already exists without prompting.
</Warning>

### `-d, --dry-run`
Only display what would have been done without making any changes.

```bash
conda rename -n oldenv newenv --dry-run
```

### `-q, --quiet`
Do not display progress bar.

```bash
conda rename -n oldenv newenv --quiet
```

### `--json`
Report all output as JSON.

```bash
conda rename -n oldenv newenv --json
```

## Restrictions

The following environments **cannot be renamed**:

1. **Base environment**: The root conda environment cannot be renamed
2. **Currently active environment**: You must deactivate an environment before renaming it
3. **Default activation environment**: If an environment is configured as `default_activation_env` in your conda configuration, it cannot be renamed

## Common Use Cases

### Rename environment by name

```bash
conda rename -n test123 test321
```

### Rename environment by path

```bash
conda rename -p /path/to/test123 test321
```

### Preview rename operation

See what would happen without making changes:

```bash
conda rename -n oldenv newenv --dry-run
```

Output:
```
DRY RUN PREFIX clone /path/to/oldenv,/path/to/newenv
DRY RUN PREFIX rm_rf /path/to/oldenv
```

### Force rename without confirmation

```bash
conda rename -n oldenv newenv --yes
```

### Rename to specific path

```bash
conda rename -n myenv /custom/path/mynewenv
```

## How It Works

The `conda rename` command performs the following steps:

1. **Validates source environment**:
   - Ensures the environment exists
   - Checks it's not the base environment
   - Checks it's not currently active
   - Checks it's not the default activation environment

2. **Validates destination**:
   - Ensures destination doesn't exist (or `--yes` is used)
   - Validates the destination path/name is valid

3. **Clones the environment**:
   - Creates a complete copy of the environment at the new location
   - Preserves all packages and their versions

4. **Removes the original**:
   - Deletes the original environment directory

<Note>
The rename operation is atomic when using the `--yes` flag, meaning if something goes wrong, the operation is rolled back.
</Note>

## Example: Complete Workflow

```bash
# Create an environment
conda create -n development python=3.11 numpy pandas

# Later, rename it
conda rename -n development production

# Verify the rename
conda env list
```

## Error Handling

### Base environment error

```bash
conda rename -n base newname
```
```
CondaEnvException: The 'base' environment cannot be renamed
```

### Active environment error

```bash
conda activate myenv
conda rename -n myenv newname
```
```
CondaEnvException: Cannot rename the active environment
```

**Solution**: Deactivate first:
```bash
conda deactivate
conda rename -n myenv newname
```

### Destination exists error

```bash
conda rename -n oldenv existingenv
```
```
CondaEnvException: The environment 'existingenv' already exists. Override with --yes.
```

**Solution**: Use `--yes` to overwrite or choose a different name:
```bash
conda rename -n oldenv existingenv --yes
```

## Performance Considerations

- Renaming large environments can take time as it involves cloning all packages
- The operation requires enough disk space to temporarily hold both environments
- Network access is not required (unlike `conda create`)

<Note>
Unlike creating a new environment from scratch, renaming preserves the exact state of the original environment, including all package metadata and history.
