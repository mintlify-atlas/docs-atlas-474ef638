description: Remove a conda environment

## Overview

The `conda env remove` command removes (deletes) a conda environment and all of its installed packages. This operation is destructive and cannot be undone.

<Warning>
**Destructive Operation**

This command permanently deletes the environment and all its contents. Make sure to deactivate the environment before removing it.
</Warning>

## Syntax

```bash
conda env remove [options]
```

## Target Environment Specification

<ParamField path="-n, --name" type="string">
  Name of environment to remove.
  
  <Note>
  You must specify either `-n` or `-p` to identify the environment to remove.
  </Note>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-p, --prefix" type="string">
  Full path to environment location (i.e. prefix) to remove.
</ParamField>

## Protection Options

<ParamField path="--override-frozen" type="boolean">
  DANGEROUS. Use at your own risk. Ignore protections if the environment is frozen.
  
  <Warning>
  Frozen environments are typically protected to prevent accidental deletion. Only use this flag if you're certain you want to remove a frozen environment.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

## Output Options

<ParamField path="--json" type="boolean">
  Report all output as JSON. Suitable for using conda programmatically.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-y, --yes" type="boolean">
  Do not ask for confirmation. Automatically answer 'yes' to all prompts.
  
  <Tip>
  Useful in scripts and automated workflows where interactive prompts should be avoided.
  </Tip>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-v, --verbose" type="boolean">
  Can be used multiple times. Once for INFO, twice for DEBUG, three times for TRACE.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-q, --quiet" type="boolean">
  Do not display progress bar.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-d, --dry-run" type="boolean">
  Only display what would have been done without actually removing the environment.
</ParamField>

## Solver Options

<ParamField path="--solver" type="string">
  Choose which solver backend to use (primarily for consistency with other commands).
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Remove environment by name

```bash
conda env remove -n myenv
```

### Remove without confirmation

```bash
conda env remove -n myenv -y
```

Removes the environment without prompting for confirmation.

### Remove frozen environment

```bash
conda env remove -n myenv --override-frozen
```

Removes a frozen environment (use with caution).

### Dry run to preview

```bash

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clean up old environments">
    Remove environments you no longer need:
    
    ```bash
    # List all environments first
    conda env list

    conda env remove -n old-project
    conda env remove -n test-env
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Free up disk space">
    Check environment sizes and remove large unused ones:
    
    ```bash
    # Check sizes
    conda env list --size
    
    # Remove large unused environment
    conda env remove -n large-env
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remove before recreating">
    Remove and recreate an environment with fresh packages:
    
    ```bash
    conda env remove -n myenv
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automated cleanup in scripts">
    Remove temporary environments in CI/CD pipelines:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Create temporary test environment
    conda create -n test-$BUILD_ID python=3.11 pytest
    
    # Run tests
    conda run -n test-$BUILD_ID pytest
    
    # Clean up
    conda env remove -n test-$BUILD_ID -y
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remove corrupted environments">
    If an environment becomes corrupted, remove and recreate it:
    
    ```bash
    conda env remove -n corrupted-env -y
    conda env create -n corrupted-env -f backup-environment.yml
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Safety Checks

Before removing an environment, conda performs several checks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Environment must exist">
    Conda verifies the environment exists before attempting removal.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Environment must be inactive">
    You cannot remove the currently active environment. Deactivate it first:
    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    conda env remove -n myenv
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Frozen environment protection">
    Frozen environments cannot be removed unless `--override-frozen` is used.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirmation prompt">
    Unless `-y` is specified, conda will ask for confirmation before deletion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Removed

When you remove an environment, conda deletes:

- All installed packages
- Python interpreter
- All conda-managed files
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Activation/deactivation scripts
- Any files in the environment directory

<Warning>
**All files are deleted**

This includes any files you may have manually added to the environment directory. Back up important files before removing an environment.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot remove active environment">
    Deactivate the environment first:
    
    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    conda env remove -n myenv
    ```
    
    If you have stacked environments, deactivate all of them:
    
    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    conda deactivate  # Repeat as needed
    conda env remove -n myenv
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Environment not found">
    Verify the environment exists:
    
    ```bash
    conda env list
    ```
    
    Use the exact name or full path shown in the list:
    
    ```bash
    conda env remove -n exact-name
    # or
    conda env remove -p /full/path/shown/in/list
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied">
    If you get permission errors:
    
    1. Ensure you have write permissions to the environment directory
    2. Close any programs that might be using files in the environment
    3. On Windows, ensure no processes are running from that environment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Frozen environment protection">
    If the environment is frozen:
    
    ```bash
    conda env remove -n myenv --override-frozen
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    Only use this if you're certain. Frozen environments are protected for a reason.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Partial removal or errors">
    If removal fails partway through:
    
    1. Try running the command again
    2. Manually remove the directory:
    ```bash
    # Get the path
    conda env list
    # Remove manually (use with caution)
    rm -rf /path/to/env
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

  <Card title="Export Before Removing" icon="download">
    Save environment specifications before removal:
    ```bash
    conda env export -n myenv > myenv-backup.yml
    conda env remove -n myenv
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Verify Before Deleting" icon="check">
    Double-check you're removing the correct environment:

    conda env list
    conda env remove -n correct-env-name
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use Dry Run First" icon="eye">
    Preview what will be removed:
    ```bash
    conda env remove -n myenv --dry-run
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Deactivate First" icon="circle-xmark">
    Always deactivate before removing:
    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    conda env remove -n myenv
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Alternatives to Removal

Before removing an environment, consider these alternatives:

### Clean the environment

```bash
conda clean -n myenv --all
```

Removes unused packages and caches without deleting the environment.

### Update instead of recreate

```bash
conda env update -n myenv -f environment.yml --prune
```

Updates the environment to match a specification file.

### Clone for backup

```bash
conda create -n myenv-backup --clone myenv
```

Create a backup before making destructive changes.
