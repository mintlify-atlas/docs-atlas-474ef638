description: Run an executable in a conda environment
---

The `conda run` command allows you to run executables within a specified conda environment without manually activating it first.

## Syntax

```bash
conda run [options] [--] EXECUTABLE [ARGS ...]
```

## Arguments

### `EXECUTABLE [ARGS ...]`
Executable name with additional arguments to be passed to the executable on invocation.

Use `--` to separate conda options from the executable's options:

```bash
conda run -n myenv -- python -v
conda run -v -n myenv -- tar -tvf file.tar
```

## Options

### `-n, --name NAME`
Name of the environment to run the command in.

```bash
conda run -n myenv python script.py
```

### `-p, --prefix PREFIX`
Full path to the environment prefix to run the command in.

```bash
conda run -p /path/to/env python script.py
```

### `--cwd DIRECTORY`
Current working directory for the command to run in. Defaults to the user's current working directory if not specified.

```bash
conda run -n myenv --cwd /tmp python script.py
```

### `-v, --verbose`
Use once for detailed output, twice for even more detailed output.

```bash
conda run -v -n myenv python script.py
```

### `-s, --no-capture-output` / `--live-stream`
Don't capture stdout/stderr (standard out/standard error). By default, conda run captures output and displays it after the command completes. This flag streams output in real-time.

```bash
conda run -n myenv --live-stream python script.py
```

### `--debug-wrapper-scripts`
When set, where implemented, the shell wrapper scripts will use the echo command to print debugging information to stderr (standard error).

```bash
conda run --debug-wrapper-scripts -n myenv python script.py
```

### `--dev`
(Deprecated in 26.9, will be removed in 27.3)

Sets `CONDA_EXE` to `python -m conda`, assuming the current working directory contains the root of conda development sources. This is mainly for use during tests where we test new conda sources against old Python versions.

<Warning>
This option is deprecated. Set `PYTHONPATH` to the conda source root instead.
</Warning>

## Common Use Cases

### Run a Python script in a specific environment

```bash
# Create an environment
conda create -y -n my-python-env python=3.11

# Run a script without activating
conda run -n my-python-env python script.py
```

### Check Python version in an environment

```bash
conda run -n my-python-env python --version
```

### Run command with arguments that start with dashes

Use `--` to separate conda options from the executable's options:

```bash
conda run -n myenv -- python -v script.py
```

### Run command in specific directory

```bash
conda run -n myenv --cwd /path/to/project python test.py
```

### Stream output in real-time

By default, conda run captures and displays output after completion. For long-running processes:

```bash
conda run -n myenv --live-stream python long_running_script.py
```

### Run command with environment prefix

If you prefer to specify the full path:

```bash
conda run -p ~/envs/myenv python script.py
```

## How It Works

When you run `conda run`:

1. Conda creates a temporary shell wrapper script
2. The script sets up the environment (similar to activation)
3. The command is executed within that environment
4. Output is captured (unless `--no-capture-output` is used)
5. The wrapper script is cleaned up after execution
6. The exit code of the command is returned

<Note>
`conda run` is useful for:
- Running commands in environments without manual activation
- Scripting and automation
- CI/CD pipelines
- Running one-off commands in different environments
</Note>

## Exit Codes

The exit code of `conda run` matches the exit code of the executed command. If the command fails, conda run will also fail with the same exit code.

## Example: Complete Workflow

```bash
# Create an environment with specific packages
conda create -y -n data-analysis python=3.11 pandas numpy

# Run a data processing script
conda run -n data-analysis python process_data.py

# Run with verbose output
conda run -v -n data-analysis python process_data.py

# Run and stream output in real-time
conda run -n data-analysis --live-stream python long_process.py
```
