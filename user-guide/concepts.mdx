## What is Conda?

Conda is a cross-platform, language-agnostic package and environment manager. It helps you install, update, and manage packages and their dependencies, while keeping different projects isolated in separate environments.

<Info>
Conda is developed by Anaconda, Inc. and is open source. Visit the [official conda website](https://conda.io) for more information.

## Packages vs Environments

### Packages

A **package** is a bundled archive file containing:
- Compiled software libraries and executables
- Configuration files
- Metadata about dependencies and versions
- Package information in JSON format

Conda supports two package formats:
- `.conda` - The modern, faster package format (v2)
- `.tar.bz2` - The legacy package format (v1)

<CodeGroup>
```bash Package Installation
# Install a single package
conda install numpy

# Install specific version
conda install python=3.11

# Install multiple packages
conda install scipy curl wheel
```
</CodeGroup>

### Environments

An **environment** is an isolated directory containing:
- A specific collection of packages
- Its own Python/R interpreter (if applicable)
- All dependencies for those packages
- Configuration and metadata in the `conda-meta/` directory

Environments allow you to:
- Keep dependencies for different projects separate
- Use different versions of packages for different projects
- Avoid conflicts between package requirements

<Note>
The default environment is called `base` (defined as `ROOT_ENV_NAME` in the source). This is a reserved environment name along with `root`.
</Note>

## Channels and Repositories

### What are Channels?

A **channel** is a repository location where conda looks for packages. Channels are URLs that point to directories containing package files and metadata.

### Default Channels

Conda uses different default channels depending on your platform:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unix/Linux/macOS">
    ```python
    DEFAULT_CHANNELS_UNIX = (
        "https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main",
        "https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r",
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```python
    DEFAULT_CHANNELS_WIN = (
        "https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main",
        "https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r",
        "https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/msys2",
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The default channel alias is `https://conda.anaconda.org`.

### Channel Priority

Conda uses a channel priority system to determine which package to install when multiple channels have the same package:

- **Strict**: Install packages only from the highest priority channel that has them
- **Flexible**: Consider version and build information across all channels
- **Disabled**: No channel priority enforcement

<CodeGroup>
```python Channel Priority Values
class ChannelPriority(ValueEnum):
    STRICT = "strict"
    FLEXIBLE = "flexible"
    DISABLED = "disabled"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
The maximum channel priority value is 10000, reserved for packages that need to be removed or have highest priority.
</Warning>

## Prefix and Environment Paths

### What is a Prefix?

A **prefix** is the filesystem path where an environment is installed. Every conda environment has a unique prefix directory.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Example Prefixes
# Default base environment
/opt/anaconda3

# Named environment
/opt/anaconda3/envs/myproject

# Custom location
/home/user/projects/ml_project/.conda
```
</CodeGroup>

### Prefix Structure

Every conda prefix contains:

```text
prefix/
├── bin/              # Executables and scripts
├── lib/              # Libraries
├── include/          # Header files
├── conda-meta/       # Environment metadata
│   ├── history       # Installation history (PREFIX_MAGIC_FILE)
│   ├── state         # Environment state
│   ├── pinned        # Pinned packages
│   ├── frozen        # Frozen environment marker
│   └── created_at    # Creation timestamp
├── etc/
│   └── conda/
│       └── env_vars.d/  # Environment variables
└── share/            # Shared data files
```

### Environment Variables

Conda environments can define custom environment variables in the `etc/conda/env_vars.d/` directory.

<CodeGroup>
```python Special Environment Variable
# Value to unset a variable
CONDA_ENV_VARS_UNSET_VAR = "***unset***"

# Reserved variables (cannot be modified)
RESERVED_ENV_VARS = ("PATH",)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Prefix Placeholder

During package builds, conda uses a prefix placeholder for binary patching:

```python
PREFIX_PLACEHOLDER = "/opt/anaconda1anaconda2anaconda3"
```

This placeholder is replaced with the actual prefix path during installation.

## Supported Platforms

Conda supports multiple platforms and architectures:

<CodeGroup>
```python Supported Platforms
PLATFORMS = (
    "emscripten-wasm32",
    "wasi-wasm32",
    "freebsd-64",
    "linux-32",
    "linux-64",
    "linux-aarch64",
    "linux-armv6l",
    "linux-armv7l",
    "linux-ppc64",
    "linux-ppc64le",
    "linux-riscv64",
    "linux-s390x",
    "osx-64",
    "osx-arm64",
    "win-32",
    "win-64",
    "win-arm64",
    "zos-z",
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Each platform has a `noarch` subdirectory for platform-independent packages.

## Configuration Files

Conda searches for configuration files (`.condarc`) in multiple locations:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unix/Linux/macOS">
    ```python
    SEARCH_PATH = (
        "/etc/conda/.condarc",
        "/etc/conda/condarc",
        "/etc/conda/condarc.d/",
        "/var/lib/conda/.condarc",
        "/var/lib/conda/condarc",
        "/var/lib/conda/condarc.d/",
        "$CONDA_ROOT/.condarc",
        "$CONDA_ROOT/condarc",
        "$CONDA_ROOT/condarc.d/",
        "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/conda/.condarc",
        "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/conda/condarc",
        "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/conda/condarc.d/",
        "~/.config/conda/.condarc",
        "~/.config/conda/condarc",
        "~/.config/conda/condarc.d/",
        "~/.conda/.condarc",
        "~/.conda/condarc",
        "~/.conda/condarc.d/",
        "~/.condarc",
        "$CONDA_PREFIX/.condarc",
        "$CONDA_PREFIX/condarc",
        "$CONDA_PREFIX/condarc.d/",
        "$CONDARC",
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```python
    SEARCH_PATH = (
        "C:/ProgramData/conda/.condarc",
        "C:/ProgramData/conda/condarc",
        "C:/ProgramData/conda/condarc.d",
        # ... plus the common paths above
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Configuration files are loaded in order, with later files overriding earlier ones. The `$CONDARC` environment variable takes highest precedence.
