### Miniforge

Miniforge is a community-driven minimal installer that uses conda-forge as the default channel. It's ideal for users who want to use the conda-forge community packages.

  <Step title="Download Miniforge">
    Visit [conda-forge.org/download](https://conda-forge.org/download/) and download the installer for your platform.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the installer">
    Follow the same installation process as Miniconda for your operating system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Anaconda Distribution

The Anaconda Distribution includes Conda plus hundreds of pre-installed packages commonly used for data science and machine learning. This is recommended if you want a complete, ready-to-use environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Anaconda">
    Visit [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and download the installer for your platform.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the installer">
    Follow the installation wizard for your operating system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verifying Your Installation

After installation, verify that Conda is properly installed and accessible:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a new terminal">
    Open a new terminal window or command prompt to ensure the installation path is loaded.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Conda version">
    ```bash
    conda --version
    ```
    
    This should display the installed Conda version, for example:
    ```text
    conda 24.1.2
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="List installed packages (optional)">
    If you installed the Anaconda Distribution, you can see all pre-installed packages:
    
    ```bash
    conda list
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating Conda

After installation, it's a good practice to update Conda to the newest version:

```bash
$ conda update --name base conda
```

<Note>
  It is possible that `conda update` does not install the newest version if the existing `conda` version is far behind the current release. In this case, updating needs to be done in stages.
  
  For example, to update from `conda 4.12` to `conda 23.10.0`, `conda 22.11.1` needs to be installed first:
  
  ```bash
  $ conda install --name base conda=22.11.1
  $ conda update conda
  ```
</Note>
